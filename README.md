# city-weather

city-weather is a web development project that displays a 5-day forecast of any city from user input. It will also display the weather of the current hour based on the city's timezone.

I wanted to build this project because I found the idea of a weather app interesting. Developing this project helped me understand APIs, the file type JSON, and using different frameworks (i.e. Flask, Bootstrap).
